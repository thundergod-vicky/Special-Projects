# 💕 Valentine Propose Day Website

A cute, funny Valentine's / Propose Day proposal website with teddies, hearts, and animations.

## What's inside

- **Intro** – "Propose Day Special" with a cute teddy and "Open the surprise" button
- **Proposal** – "Will you be my Valentine?" with **Yes** and **Maybe later**  
  (hover "Maybe later" and the button runs away – so she has to say Yes 😄)
- **Celebration** – Confetti and "She said YES!" when she clicks Yes

## Run locally

```bash
cd valentine-proposal
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) and share the link or screen with your girlfriend.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
